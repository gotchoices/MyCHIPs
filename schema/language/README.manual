This file documents the pre-AI method of language translation

To generate a new language file:
- Determine the 3-letter ISO code (xyz, for example) for the new language
- Edit test/mocha/language.js to include the code in the languages array (line 14)
- Make sure the last two tests are actually enabled in language.js (line 103)
- Do: cd test/auto/schema; npx mocha dbinit language (the final test should show failures)
- This should create CSV files in the data dir for any tags missing in the target language
- Open the newly created CSV file in a spreadsheet
- Perform the translation, filling in title and help columns for all applicable tags
- Make sure the file is saved back in CSV format
- Be in the mychips/schema folder (the following utilities consult Wyseman.conf)
- Import new language tags into the db:
    wm-csv2db <the_file_name>.csv
- Check in wm.table_lang (and/or UI applications) for the correct language data
- Create wyseman language files:
    wm-db2wmt -s mychips -l <xyz> >language/<schema>-<xyz>.wmt
- There are several schemas to consider (wm, wylib, base, mychips, json)
- Try to rebuild from source: "make clean lang" and make sure all tags still present in DB
- Rebuild schema files: "make schema sql" and then rerun language test above
- When satisfied, submit P/R to mychips/wyselib with language translation files/updates

The "-s schema" switch to wm-db2wmt will limit the output to those tables/views belonging
to the specified schema.  If you are translating tables/views that are part of wyselib,
make sure to include those in the wyselib/schema/language folder rather than as part of
the mychips repo.

NOTES:

If the language description for a table/view does not exist, there is nothing to
relate column/message/value tags to so even though they may import (wm-csv2db), they will 
not export (wm-db2wmt) and so will be lost.

The following query can show how many tags you have installed for a given language:
  select sorter,title from wm.language 
    where fr_lang = 'eng' and language = 'nep' and title notnull

Make sure to have the development schema installed "make dev" to access that view.
