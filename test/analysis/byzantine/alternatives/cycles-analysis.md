# Cycles Protocol Analysis

## Overview
The Cycles protocol ([Cycles Whitepaper, 2024](https://cycles.money/whitepaper.pdf)) presents a novel approach to distributed credit clearing that focuses on optimizing multilateral settlements through graph analysis. Unlike MyCHIPs and Ripple-Normal, Cycles emphasizes finding and executing optimal clearing paths across the entire network.

## Key Innovations
