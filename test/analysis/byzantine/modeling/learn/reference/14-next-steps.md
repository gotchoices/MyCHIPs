# Next Steps

**Core Chapter**: Language completeness marker - all essential TLA+ features covered in preceding chapters.

## Core Language Complete
Essential TLA+ constructs now available:
- Basic operators: arithmetic, sets, sequences, functions
- PlusCal: variables, labels, processes, procedures, macros
- Properties: invariants, temporal logic (`[]`, `<>`, `~>`), action properties
- Advanced operators: recursion, higher-order, LAMBDA, CASE
- Pure TLA+: actions, fairness (WF/SF), EXCEPT, specification structure
- Modules: EXTENDS, INSTANCE, parameterization

## Available References
- **Topics section**: Advanced patterns, optimization, design techniques
- **Examples section**: Real-world specifications and operators
- **Other Resources**: External TLA+ materials and tools

## Language Capabilities
Can now model:
- Sequential and concurrent algorithms
- Safety and liveness properties  
- Non-deterministic behaviors
- Complex data structures
- Multi-process systems with fairness
- Parameterized and reusable specifications

Core syntax mastery enables Byzantine fault tolerance analysis and distributed system verification.
