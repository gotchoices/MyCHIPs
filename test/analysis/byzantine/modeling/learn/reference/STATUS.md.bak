# TLA+ Tutorial Reference Status

## Project Objectives

**Mission**: Digest all content from [learntla.com](https://learntla.com) and create ultra-compact summaries optimized for AI context loading, enabling confident TLA+ assistance without guessing or hallucination.

**Success Metrics**:
- [ ] **Complete Coverage**: Every tutorial chapter summarized  
- [ ] **Compact Format**: Each summary ~200-300 words maximum
- [ ] **Actionable Knowledge**: Include minimal working examples
- [ ] **Integration Ready**: Cross-reference with existing resources
- [ ] **Verification**: AI can answer TLA+ questions with certainty

## Tutorial Chapter Progress

### Intro Section
- [ ] **Conceptual Overview** - Understanding TLA+ purpose and structure
- [ ] **FAQ** - Common questions and clarifications  
- [ ] **What's New** - Recent updates and changes

### TLA+ Core
- [ ] **Setup** - Installation and tooling configuration
- [ ] **An Example** - First complete specification walkthrough
- [ ] **Operators** - Basic operators and expressions
- [ ] **Simple Operators** - Arithmetic and logical operations
- [ ] **Sets** - Set theory fundamentals and operations
- [ ] **Logic** - Boolean logic and predicates
- [ ] **Functions** - Function definition and manipulation
- [ ] **Conditionals** - If-then-else and case statements
- [ ] **Structs** - Records and structured data
- [ ] **Sequences** - Ordered collections and operations
- [ ] **Invariants** - Safety properties and type checking
- [ ] **Temporal Logic** - Always and eventually operators
- [ ] **Auxiliary Variables** - Helper variables for specifications

### TLA+ Topics (Advanced)
- [ ] **Concurrency** - Modeling concurrent and distributed systems
- [ ] **Constants and Models** - Parameterization and model configuration
- [ ] **Specification** - Complete specification structure
- [ ] **Fairness** - Liveness properties and fair execution
- [ ] **Refinement** - Relating abstract and concrete specifications
- [ ] **State Machines** - State-based modeling patterns

### Examples Section
- [ ] **Example Operators** - Common operator patterns and usage
- [ ] **PlusCal Specs** - Algorithm-style specifications
- [ ] **Real-World Examples** - Industrial specification patterns

### Reference Materials
- [ ] **Standard Modules** - Built-in TLA+ modules and their usage
- [ ] **Glossary** - Definitions of key terms
- [ ] **Other Resources** - External learning materials

## Integration Tasks

- [ ] **Cross-Reference** with `../summary-standalone.pdf` cheat sheet
- [ ] **Validate Examples** against working DieHard and TCommit models
- [ ] **Extract Patterns** relevant to MyCHIPs Byzantine modeling
- [ ] **Document Pitfalls** and common mistakes
- [ ] **Create Quick Reference** for most-used concepts

## Current Status

**Active Work**: Setting up reference framework

**Next Priority**: Begin with Conceptual Overview chapter

**Completion Target**: Systematic progression through all chapters

**Quality Check**: Each summary must enable confident AI assistance on TLA+ questions

## MyCHIPs Integration

This knowledge base directly supports:
- **Phase 1-2**: Basic TLA+ syntax and simple models
- **Phase 3-4**: Distributed consensus and Byzantine fault tolerance  
- **Phase 5-6**: Complex attack scenarios and recovery protocols
- **ChipNetBasic**: Debugging and completing the comprehensive specification

**Bottom Line**: Transform from "guessing about TLA+" to "confidently teaching TLA+" through systematic knowledge capture.
