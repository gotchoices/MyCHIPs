# TLA+ Learning Context

## Purpose
This folder is provided to help users learn TLA+ and PlusCal as part of the broader MyCHIPs Byzantine fault tolerance analysis project.

## Project Structure
- **Parent Project**: MyCHIPs distributed credit clearing system
- **Current Focus**: Formal verification of Byzantine fault tolerance properties
- **Learning Goal**: Build competency in TLA+/PlusCal for modeling ChipNet consensus protocol

## Documentation Resources

### AI-Generated Reference
- **Location**: `reference/` subfolder  
- **Content**: Concentrated summary of TLA+/PlusCal language features
- **Purpose**: AI agents should consult these summaries rather than guessing about language syntax/semantics

### Human Reference  
- **File**: `summary-standalone.pdf`
- **Content**: TLA+ command and syntax cheat sheet
- **Limitation**: Binary format, not AI-parseable - for human reference only

## Key Guidelines
1. **For AI Agents**: Always consult the `reference/` summaries for TLA+/PlusCal questions
2. **Learning Path**: Progress from simple examples to complex MyCHIPs protocol modeling
3. **Detailed Objectives**: See `../README.md` for comprehensive project goals

## Next Steps
Work through TLA+ learning examples, starting with TCommit, to build toward formal verification of MyCHIPs Byzantine fault tolerance properties.
