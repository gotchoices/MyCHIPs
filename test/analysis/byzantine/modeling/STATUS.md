# MyCHIPs Modeling Progress Status

## Overview

This tracks our progress in developing formal verification models for MyCHIPs, starting with simple TLA+ concepts and building toward comprehensive Byzantine fault tolerance verification of the lift recovery scheme.

## Phase 1: TLA+ Fundamentals ✅

**Basic syntax and simple models to establish TLA+ competency**

- [x] **DieHard** - Water jug puzzle (basic TLA+ syntax)
- [x] **TCommit** - Two-phase commit (distributed systems basics)
- [ ] **Counter** - Simple counter with increment/decrement
- [ ] **BankAccount** - Account balance that can't go negative
- [ ] **SimpleConsensus** - Basic majority voting

## Phase 2: Credit Relationship Modeling

**Model basic MyCHIPs credit concepts without distributed complexity**

- [ ] **CreditRelationship** - Two parties with mutual credit limits
- [ ] **TallyOperations** - Basic chit creation and balance updates  
- [ ] **CreditConservation** - Verify credits are never created/destroyed
- [ ] **TriangleCredit** - Three parties (A owes B, B owes C, C owes A)
- [ ] **SimpleClearing** - When triangle credits can be cleared
- [ ] **LinearChain** - Credit chain A→B→C→D

## Phase 3: Distributed Consensus Basics

**Add network communication and timeouts to credit models**

- [ ] **AsyncTransfer** - Credit transfer with messages and acknowledgments
- [ ] **TimeoutHandling** - Model what happens when messages are lost
- [ ] **TwoPhaseCre dit** - Two-phase commit for credit transfer
- [ ] **RefereeDecision** - External referee decides on credit transfer
- [ ] **MultiReferee** - Multiple referees voting on decisions
- [ ] **RefereeFailure** - What happens when referee becomes unavailable

## Phase 4: Byzantine Fault Tolerance

**Introduce malicious actors and network failures**

- [ ] **HonestVsMalicious** - Model nodes that follow vs. break protocol
- [ ] **ByzantineVoting** - Majority voting with Byzantine nodes
- [ ] **CreditAttack** - Model attempts to create or steal credits
- [ ] **NetworkPartition** - Model network splits during operations
- [ ] **PartitionRecovery** - Model partition healing and reconciliation

## Phase 5: MyCHIPs Attack Scenarios

**Model specific attacks that motivated the insurance chit protocol**

- [ ] **PromiseAbandon** - Nodes going offline after promising
- [ ] **CircuitStarvation** - Full 7-node circuit starvation scenario
- [ ] **StarvationImpact** - Verify impact on honest minority
- [ ] **AttackVectorsComprehensive** - Systematic attack enumeration

## Phase 6: Lift Recovery Protocol  

**Model and verify the insurance chit minority recovery mechanism**

- [ ] **InsuranceChits** - Basic insurance chit creation and resolution
- [ ] **MinorityRecovery** - Full minority recovery protocol
- [ ] **RaceConditions** - Behavior when majority returns during recovery
- [ ] **EconomicInvariants** - Verify no net value created/destroyed
- [ ] **RecoveryCompleteness** - All honest nodes can continue trading

## Phase 7: ChipNet Integration

**Complete comprehensive model and validate against regular lifts**

- [ ] **ChipNetBasic** - Fix syntax errors in the comprehensive specification
- [ ] **RegularLifts** - Verify normal lift operation without attacks
- [ ] **FlexibleConsensus** - Model runtime consensus mechanism selection
- [ ] **BackwardCompatibility** - Ensure single-referee mode still works
- [ ] **PerformanceProperties** - Liveness and progress under normal operation

## Phase 8: Comprehensive Validation

**Final integration and comparison with historical analyses**

- [ ] **DSRCompatibility** - Reproduce DSR's identified issues with old protocol
- [ ] **BYUConsistency** - Verify single-referee cases match BYU results  
- [ ] **ScalabilityAnalysis** - Model checking with larger node counts
- [ ] **EdgeCaseValidation** - Test boundary conditions and corner cases
- [ ] **PropertyCompleteness** - Comprehensive safety and liveness verification

## Current Status

**Active Work**: Phase 1 ✅ (DieHard and TCommit learning models complete)

**Next Priority**: Complete Phase 1 fundamentals, then begin Phase 2 credit modeling

**Broken Model**: `ChipNetBasic.tla` has syntax errors and represents an early AI attempt to jump to the finish line. We need to work systematically through simpler models first.

## Key Milestones

- [ ] **Phase 2 Complete**: Can model basic credit relationships correctly
- [ ] **Phase 4 Complete**: Can model Byzantine attacks effectively  
- [ ] **Phase 6 Complete**: Insurance chit recovery protocol verified
- [ ] **Phase 7 Complete**: `ChipNetBasic.tla` fixed and comprehensive
- [ ] **Phase 8 Complete**: Full validation against historical findings

**Success Criteria**: 
1. Regular lifts work correctly under normal conditions
2. Insurance chit recovery handles circuit starvation attacks
3. Byzantine fault tolerance properties hold with minority malicious nodes
4. Backward compatibility with single-referee protocol maintained
