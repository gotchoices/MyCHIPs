# Byzantine Attack Index

## Summary Overview

MyCHIPs has **strong defenses** against Byzantine attacks through its social trust model, cryptographic validation, and consensus mechanisms. Most attack vectors are either fully mitigated or have workarounds that limit damage to attackers themselves.

**Recent Development**: The [Insurance Chit Protocol](../scenarios/minority-recovery-3.md) significantly strengthens defenses against circuit starvation and related attack vectors.

## By Defense Status (Primary Organization)

### FULLY MITIGATED ‚úÖ
Attacks that are effectively prevented or cause no harm to honest participants:

**High Confidence Mitigations:**
- [Deadbeat Attack](deadbeat.md) - Only attacker loses value; protected by conditional commitments
- [Message Tampering](message-tampering.md) - Prevented by cryptographic signatures and integrity checks
- [Split Vote Attack](split-vote.md) - Prevented by majority consensus requirements

**Strong Mitigations with Minor Edge Cases:**
- [Double-Commit Attack](double-commit.md) - Prevented by transaction locking; edge cases involve complex timing
- [False Promise Attack](false-promise.md) - Prevented by credit validation and partner oversight

### SUBSTANTIALLY MITIGATED ‚ö†Ô∏è
Attacks with good defenses but some operational impact or edge cases:

**Network-Level Disruptions:**
- [Network Partition](network-partition.md) - Causes delays but preserves integrity; Insurance Chit Protocol provides recovery
- [Signature Withholding](signature-withholding.md) - Causes delays; timeouts and direct referee contact provide workarounds

**Coordination Attacks:**
- [Selective Communication](selective-communication.md) - Limited by redundant paths and peer discovery
- [Delayed Vote Attack](delayed-vote.md) - Limited by timeout mechanisms and performance optimization

### PARTIALLY MITIGATED üîç
Attacks requiring ongoing vigilance or system improvements:

**Resource/Performance Attacks:**
- [Replay Attacks](replay-attacks.md) - Basic protection exists; ongoing protocol enhancements needed

**Assessment**: No attacks in this category cause financial loss to honest participants. Remaining concerns are primarily operational efficiency.

## By Practical Threat Level

### NEGLIGIBLE THREAT üü¢
Attacks that are economically irrational or technically defeated:
- [Deadbeat Attack](deadbeat.md) - Self-defeating; only harms attacker
- [Message Tampering](message-tampering.md) - Cryptographically infeasible
- [False Promise Attack](false-promise.md) - Prevented by validation layers
- [Double-Commit Attack](double-commit.md) - Requires complex coordination with minimal gain

### LOW THREAT üü°
Attacks that can cause operational disruption but no financial harm:
- [Split Vote Attack](split-vote.md) - Requires referee corruption; limited impact
- [Network Partition](network-partition.md) - Natural failures handled; malicious variants expensive
- [Signature Withholding](signature-withholding.md) - Temporary disruption only
- [Selective Communication](selective-communication.md) - Limited effectiveness due to redundancy

### MODERATE THREAT üü†
Attacks that may impact system performance or user experience:
- [Delayed Vote Attack](delayed-vote.md) - Can cause user frustration; optimization needed
- [Replay Attacks](replay-attacks.md) - Can consume resources; monitoring required

**Note**: No attacks reach "High Threat" level - MyCHIPs' social trust model and technical architecture provide robust protection.

## By Attack Nature

### Malicious (Intentional)
Require deliberate misconduct:
- [Split Vote Attack](split-vote.md) - Malicious referee
- [Double-Commit Attack](double-commit.md) - Coordinated deception
- [False Promise Attack](false-promise.md) - Credit manipulation
- [Signature Withholding](signature-withholding.md) - Intentional disruption
- [Selective Communication](selective-communication.md) - Modified client software
- [Message Tampering](message-tampering.md) - Protocol attacks
- [Replay Attacks](replay-attacks.md) - Resource attacks

### Mixed (Malicious or Inadvertent)
Can occur through technical failures or malicious action:
- [Deadbeat Attack](deadbeat.md) - Node crashes or intentional disconnection
- [Network Partition](network-partition.md) - Network failures or BGP attacks
- [Delayed Vote Attack](delayed-vote.md) - Network congestion or intentional delays

## By Likelihood

### High Probability (Common Failures)
- [Network Partition](network-partition.md) - Natural network failures
- [Deadbeat Attack](deadbeat.md) - Node crashes, network issues
- [Delayed Vote Attack](delayed-vote.md) - Network latency, congestion

### Medium Probability (Requires Sophistication)
- [Signature Withholding](signature-withholding.md) - Intentional disruption
- [Selective Communication](selective-communication.md) - Modified software
- [Split Vote Attack](split-vote.md) - Referee corruption

### Low Probability (Highly Sophisticated)
- [Message Tampering](message-tampering.md) - Cryptographic attacks
- [Double-Commit Attack](double-commit.md) - Complex coordination
- [Replay Attacks](replay-attacks.md) - Protocol manipulation
- [False Promise Attack](false-promise.md) - Complex validation bypass

## By Lift Type Impact

### Linear Lifts (Payments)
Particularly vulnerable:
- [False Promise Attack](false-promise.md) - Targets payment initiation
- [Network Partition](network-partition.md) - Can break payment pathways

### Both Linear and Circular Lifts
Affect all transaction types:
- [Deadbeat Attack](deadbeat.md) - Node failure impacts any lift type
- [Double-Commit Attack](double-commit.md) - Transaction integrity issue
- [Signature Withholding](signature-withholding.md) - Affects consensus process
- [Split Vote Attack](split-vote.md) - Referee-level attack
- [Delayed Vote Attack](delayed-vote.md) - Timing attack
- [Selective Communication](selective-communication.md) - Network-level disruption
- [Message Tampering](message-tampering.md) - Protocol-level attack
- [Replay Attacks](replay-attacks.md) - Resource consumption

### No Circular-Specific Attacks
All identified attacks either affect both lift types or specifically target linear lifts.

## By Social Trust Barrier

### High Trust Barrier (Relationship Investment Required)
- [Double-Commit Attack](double-commit.md) - Multiple trading relationships
- [False Promise Attack](false-promise.md) - Credit history and trust required
- [Deadbeat Attack](deadbeat.md) - Established partnerships needed

### Medium Trust Barrier (Limited Relationships)
- [Split Vote Attack](split-vote.md) - Referee relationships
- [Signature Withholding](signature-withholding.md) - Direct partnerships
- [Selective Communication](selective-communication.md) - Network presence

### Low Trust Barrier (Technical Attacks)
- [Network Partition](network-partition.md) - Network-level attack
- [Message Tampering](message-tampering.md) - Protocol-level attack
- [Replay Attacks](replay-attacks.md) - Technical exploit
- [Delayed Vote Attack](delayed-vote.md) - Timing manipulation

## Key Insights

### MyCHIPs Strength Areas
1. **Social Trust Model**: High-trust-barrier attacks are economically irrational
2. **Cryptographic Integrity**: Message tampering and replay attacks are well-defended
3. **Consensus Robustness**: Split votes and coordination attacks have limited impact
4. **Self-Correcting Economics**: Attackers typically harm themselves more than victims

### Areas for Continued Vigilance
1. **Network Performance**: Optimization of timeout and retry mechanisms
2. **Operational Efficiency**: Minimizing disruption from natural failures
3. **Protocol Evolution**: Ongoing improvements to replay attack defenses

### Insurance Chit Protocol Impact
The recently developed Insurance Chit Protocol significantly improves resilience against:
- **Circuit Starvation**: Core motivation for the protocol
- **Network Partition**: Provides recovery mechanism for hung lifts
- **Deadbeat Attack**: Alternative resolution path when nodes become unresponsive
- **Delayed Vote Attack**: Reduces impact of timing-based disruptions
