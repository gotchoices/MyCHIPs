# Attack Scenarios

## Purpose
This folder contains analysis of complex, real-world attack scenarios that combine multiple basic attack vectors. While individual attacks are important to understand and mitigate, sophisticated attackers often combine multiple techniques to achieve their goals.

## Scenario Structure
Each scenario document includes:

1. **Overview**
   - Attack objective
   - Required resources/capabilities
   - Expected impact
   - Business motivation

2. **Component Attacks**
   - Primary attack vectors used
   - How attacks are combined/coordinated
   - Novel aspects of combination

3. **Detailed Flow**
   - Step-by-step attack progression
   - Timing and coordination details
   - Network/node diagrams
   - State transitions

4. **Impact Analysis**
   - Direct financial impact
   - Operational disruption
   - Resource consumption
   - Trust/reputation effects
   - Recovery costs

5. **Detection Points**
   - Observable indicators
   - Warning signs
   - Monitoring requirements
   - Audit trail analysis

6. **Mitigation Analysis**
   - How existing mitigations interact
   - Gaps in coverage
   - New mitigation requirements
   - Recommended improvements

7. **Recovery Process**
   - Immediate response steps
   - Resource recovery
   - State reconciliation
   - Long-term prevention

## Usage Guidelines
- Focus on realistic, motivated attacks
- Include clear diagrams showing attack flow
- Reference individual attack analyses
- Highlight mitigation gaps
- Propose concrete improvements
