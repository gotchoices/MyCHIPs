This folder contains a sample self-signed site certificate.

You can build your own site certificate by:

- Editing the information in self_cert.conf to fit your site; and then
- running: npm run makecert

This will build the files in this folder:
  server_certificate.pem
  server_private_key.pem
  server_public_key.pem

Your MyCHIPs server will now attempt to access these key files by default 
unless you deploy it with the -n switch.

Here are two very bad ideas not to do:

  1. Use the sample certificates, without building them specially for your
     own site.
  2. Running your server in production with the -n switch.

The -n switch runs your server without any kind of authentication at all. So 
anyone can connect to your server, logged in as any user, and make any kind of 
changes at all.  Only use this switch for testing/development purposes.

Note, if you use the self-signed certificate method, there is no way for your
users to know that they are connected to the correct site unless you give them
a copy of your certificate via an outside channel (like email it or hand it to
them in person).  Then, they will have to install the certificate in their OS
keychain or browser, as the case may be.  Otherwise, their browser will 
complain that they are connecting to an "unsafe" site.

If you are running a server for yourself, your family or friends, a self
signed certificate may work just fine.  People just need to make sure they got
a true copy of your certificate and installed it.

But if you are running a business and expect all kinds of people to connect to
your server, you will of course, want to pay for a real certificate signed
through a chain of authority your customers' browsers will trust.

Keep in mind, this certificate is used solely to establish a trusted connection
for the Wylib Administrative and User GUI interfaces to MyCHIPs.  This is the
idea:

Your user connects to a website where the SPA (Single Page Application) is
served up to their browser.  That SPA is going to do some sensitive things like
storing their private connection keys.  More importantly, it will also be 
storing their MyCHIPs trading key.  So if they get connected to a rogue site
who gives them an app that looks just like what they are used to, but has been
tampered with, there will be real problems.

So it is critical that you run your SPA server in https (sometimes called SSL
or TLS) mode.  In other words, don't use the -n switch!  Then, if you use a
self signed certificate, make sure you get a copy by safe channel and install
it for your browser.  Don't get in the habit (or teach your users) to just
bypass the browser warning that you are connected to an insecure site.  If
they just install whatever certificate comes over the wire, they may be
permanently installing the certificate for the bad guy!
