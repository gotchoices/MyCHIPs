This folder contains recipes for creating self-signed certificates.  We will
use these certificates for two distinct purposes:

  - To validate the connection between the MyCHIPs server and a client Single 
    Page Application (SPA) such as the admin console, user console, or a user 
    mobile app.
  - To validate the connection between the MyCHIPs server and the PostgreSQL
    server.

The certificates created here may be sufficient for certain production use with 
the MyCHIPs server.  However, enterprise deployments may want to user their own
certificate generation systems, including reliance on commercially recognized 
Certificate Authorities.

Local Configuration
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is a sample file in this folder called example.conf.  Start by copying it
to a file called local.conf:

  cp example.conf local.conf

Then use your editor of choice to fill in the data applicable to your site.
This file will be parsed by bash so don't interject spaces around the '=' signs.

If you don't do this step, all your certificates will be created using the
sample data in example.conf!

SPA Certificates
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
While it is possible to launch the SPA server with SSL disabled (-n switch), 
this is a very bad idea for everything except basic testing.

Instead, we will get our certificates built so your users can be sure they are
really interacting with your server and not some man-in-the-middle attack 
spoofing your users!  Just run:

  npm run makecert spa <servername.%>

where "servername" (which defaults to mychips.%) is the name of the computer 
your mychips server is running on. The ".%" is used to signal the scripts to 
substitute your domain name at the end so you get a fully qualified domain 
name as the "commonName" on your certificate.  This should be the same hostame 
your users will put into their browser URL bar to connect to the SPA.

The makecert command will build a self-signed certificate authority (CA)
certificate called "spa-ca.crt" along with its super-secret private key file
"spa-ca.key."  You will be handing out the certificate to your users, but you
must keep the key file private or your system will be compromized!

All files created by the makecert script will be placed in a "local" folder 
under the pki directory.

Also created are a key and certificate file for your MyCHIPs server.  If you
happened to name your server "mychips," the certificate file will be called
spa-mychips.crt and will be found automatically when you launch the MyCHIPs 
server process.  If you called it something different, you will have to tell
the server (via command line switches or environment variables) where to find 
the correct certificates.

For example, if your server is called "chip7," you might do something like:

  export MYCHIPS_SERVER_KEY=/opt/mychips/pki/local/spa-chip7.key
  export MYCHIPS_SERVER_CERT=/opt/mychips/pki/local/spa-chip7.crt
  npm run server

or
  npm run server \
  	--serverKey=/opt/mychips/pki/local/spa-chip7.key
  	--serverCert=/opt/mychips/pki/local/spa-chip7.crt

Again, you must keep any ".key" file completely private (never group or world 
accessible) or your system will be compromized!

In production environments, many will choose to store only encrypted versions 
of their key files online and will have to supply the pass phrase each time the 
server is launched.  That is beyond the scope of this tutorial.

Now, in order to connect to the SPA server, your users will need to install
your CA certificate in their OS or browser.  This is the file called:

  spa-ca.crt

On MAC and Windows, they should be able to double click on the file to install
the certificate.  They will then have to instruct the system that it should 
trust any certificates signed by this authority.  If you want your users to
be able to avoid this step, you will have to use a certificate signed by a
commercial certificate authority.

Keep in mind, if you are making your certificate available to users on your
web site, that site better be secured by a commercial certificate.  Otherwise
someone can just spoof your site, and give all your users a phoney CA that
assures them they are connected to your MyCHIPs server, when they really
aren't!

One other thing to note:  This SPA certificate is used only to assure your
users they are getting a correct, authorized copy of the application.  Once
the app begins to run, they will still have to have proper credentials for
connecting to the database.  These connection tokens are created in the
admin SPA and can be provided to users on a one-on-one basis.

Database Certificates
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The other thing we use certificates for is to secure the connection between the
MyCHIPs server and the PostgreSQL process.  This configuration is a little
tricky because our MyCHIPs server needs to connect on behalf of a variety of
different users.

If both processes (MyCHIPs and PostgreSQL) are running on the same server, and 
that server is properly secured, you may be able to get by without an SSL 
connection between them.

In your PostgreSQL configuration you could put something like this in the 
pg_hba.conf file:

local		mychips	+users				trust

Then you might need another line like this:

local		all	admin				peer

So you can connect as the administrator for working on the database.  You
would need to log into the host machine as the user "admin" in order to do
this.

For an SSL-secured connection, we will need to create keys as follows:

  npm run makecert data <servername.%>
  npm run makecert data admin
  npm run makecert data users

This will produce a separate Certificate Authority solely for our database
connection.  

This is important to note if you are cooking up your own keys:

DO NOT use a regular commercial or system-wide key set to secure this 
connection.  The problem is, we are using the "trust" method of authentication
in order to allow MyCHIPs to connect on behalf of multiple users.  So so any 
process possessing ANY certificate signed by the specified CA authority
will be able to connect to the database AS ANY USER!

For this reason, we have a separate CA just for the database connection.  And
we will only create two client keys: one to connect as regular users, and
another to connect as regular MyCHIPs users.

Add the following lines to your pg_hba.conf file:

hostssl		all	admin		all		cert
hostssl		all	+users		samehost	trust

Then you will need to configure PostgreSQL to use the supplied certificates.
For example, if PostgreSQL is running on a machine called "mychips," you should
have created a certificate called "data-mychips.crt".  Copy this certificate and
its associated key into the PostgreSQL configuration data directory.  Also copy
the CA certificate as follows:

  cd /var/lib/pgsql/data		#Or wherever PostgreSQL is installed
  cp ~/mychips/pki/local/data-mychips.crt .
  cp ~/mychips/pki/local/data-mychips.key .
  cp ~/mychips/pki/local/data-ca.crt .

Then modify postgresql.conf as follows:

  ssl = on
  ssl_cert_file = 'data-mychips.crt'
  ssl_key_file = 'data-mychips.key'
  ssl_ca_file = 'data-ca.crt'

Then restart the database:

  systemctl restart postgresql

If you used these standard names, and the certificates exist in pki/local, the 
the MyCHIPs server should be able to find them and use them when connecting to
the database.  If you used a different configuration, you may have to specify
certificate names/locations using environment variables or command line 
switches (see bin/mychips.js for specifics).

BTW, if your PostgreSQL is running on a different machine, you will probably
have to set this in postgresql.conf too:

  listen_addresses = '*'		#Or enter a specific interface

And (this is unrelated to SSL connections but) Wylib operates best with this 
setting as well:

  datestyle = 'iso'
