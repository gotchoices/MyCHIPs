Chark mobile application development

Immediate:
X-  Can build for IOS
X-  Put latest version in both stores
X-  IOS build not launching connection deep link (see detailed plan in deep-linking-issue.md)
X- Review mapping of /invite, /pay to /ticket; why is this done?
X- Review bin/build; Can/should we automate distribution with fastlane?
X- Owner name not showing up for p1004
- Find any language tags not yet implemented
- Review how redux stores state
- Evaluate use of wyseman/message module; make our own handling of lang tags?
- If key signature fails, why don't we get an error back to the app (general err handling)
- Can we re-sign existing tallies (for debugging only)?
- Test all deep link modes
- Try to add setting for explicit CHIP conversion ratio
- How is tally list maintained (in view or local cache of model)?
- Generalize wyseman to handle sync or async localstorage
- Should wyseman be caching regular queries or only data dictionary stuff?
- Can a request() invoke the callback more than once
- Should a request return a promise if no callback is given?
- Lazy connection to backend
- Why do we lose our connection key?
- Should upgrade to RN 0.78 (or later)?
- Do we still use the 'mychips://' deep link prefix for anything?
- 

Maintenance:
X- Can build/run on android emulator
- Can build/run on IOS simulator
- Can run on tethered device
- Build version and post in App Store
- Build version and post in Play Store
- Can we build IOS version from command line (make npm script)

Roadmap:
- Profile email/phone show "primary_text" rather than "Primary"
- Review App->linking->getStateFromPath; fix path logic
- Examine how wyseman API handles async messages
- wm.request() can call cb() multiple times but is currently wrapped in a promise
  in services/request.js.  Call to fetchTallies initially pulls from localStorage.
  Is later cb() ignored when real data comes?
- Language changes update UI
- Test all signup vectors
  - Download app on App/Play
  - See app on mychips.org
  - Signup on mychips.net
  - Receive tally invitation
  - Receive CHIP payment
- MyCHIPs.net uses auth library for account/password maintenance
- Launch app w/o Internet connection
  - Can generate local payments

Old:
- App knows when new user has not connected yet:
-  Displays simplified page allowing only: scan QR
-  Processing of deep links also allowed at this point
- Local connection key stored securely?
-  Can use of connection key be enabled by biometrics?
-  Can import/export connection keys?
- Upon connection, app obtains user profile
-  User guided/encouraged to complete his own profile
-   Select unique CHIP ID
-   address information
-   contact information (phone, web, text gateway)
-   birth record
-   personal photo (scale down and store in file_v_me)
-   create signing key
-   store signing key securely
