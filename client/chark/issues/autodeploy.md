# Automated Build and Deployment Strategy for MyCHIPs Mobile App

## Issue Summary
The MyCHIPs mobile app currently lacks a streamlined automated process for building and deploying to multiple targets (mychips.org, Play Store, App Store/TestFlight), requiring manual intervention and lacking standardized procedures.

## Current Status
- An existing `bin/build` script can build and deploy Android APKs to mychips.org
- iOS build automation is incomplete and untested
- No automated process exists for generating production-ready bundles for store submissions
- No consistent workflow for handling app signing and versioning

## Security Requirements
- App signing keys and keystores must remain on local development machines
- No third-party services should have access to signing credentials
- Build process must support secure, local signing while still enabling automated submission

## Goals
1. **Standardized Build Pipeline**:
   - Create consistent, reproducible builds for both platforms
   - Automate versioning and metadata updates
   - Centralize build configuration

2. **Multi-Target Deployment**:
   - Maintain existing mychips.org deployment capability
   - Add automated submission to Play Store
   - Add automated submission to App Store/TestFlight
   - Clear separation between build and submission steps

3. **Developer Experience**:
   - Simple npm scripts for various build/deploy targets
   - Clear documentation for the build/deployment process
   - Minimal manual steps required

## Proposed Approach: Fastlane Integration with Local Signing

### 1. Implement Fastlane
Fastlane is the industry standard for mobile app deployment automation and addresses our needs:
- Supports both building and submitting apps to both stores
- Works with local signing (keeps keystores on your machine)
- Can automate all aspects: building, signing, versioning, metadata, screenshots, and submissions
- Supports complex workflows via "lanes"

### 2. Build and Submission Architecture
Structure the process with security in mind:
1. **Local Build Phase**: Executed on developer machine with local credentials
   - App signing and packaging
   - Creation of release artifacts
   
2. **Submission Phase**: Could be local or automated via CI
   - Upload to app stores
   - No access to signing keys required for this phase
   - Can use application-specific passwords for Apple and API keys for Google

### 3. Command Line Interface Approach
After analysis, we recommend using Fastlane directly through npm scripts rather than maintaining a separate bin/build wrapper script:

**Benefits of this approach:**
- Reduces abstraction layers and maintenance overhead
- Provides clear, descriptive commands for different build targets
- Follows industry standards, improving developer onboarding
- Maintains full access to Fastlane's extensive capabilities
- Simplifies documentation and workflow understanding

**Example package.json scripts:**
```json
"scripts": {
  "build:android:apk": "cd android && fastlane build_apk",
  "build:android:bundle": "cd android && fastlane build_app_bundle",
  "deploy:android:mychips": "cd android && fastlane deploy_to_mychips",
  "deploy:android:playstore": "cd android && fastlane deploy_to_playstore",
  "build:ios:archive": "cd ios && fastlane build_archive",
  "deploy:ios:testflight": "cd ios && fastlane beta",
  "deploy:ios:appstore": "cd ios && fastlane release"
}
```

### 4. Implementation Plan
1. **Phase 1: Fastlane Setup**
   - Install and initialize Fastlane for both platforms
   - Create basic lanes for building signed releases
   - Define npm scripts that call Fastlane lanes directly

2. **Phase 2: Feature Implementation**
   - Implement all required build and deployment lanes
   - Add support for increment versioning
   - Document the process thoroughly

3. **Phase 3: App Store Submission**
   - Implement submission lanes for TestFlight
   - Implement submission lanes for Play Store
   - Test end-to-end process

4. **Phase 4: CI/CD Integration (Optional)**
   - If desired, configure GitHub Actions for submissions only
   - Keep signing process local
   - Use encrypted secrets for store credentials only (not signing keys)
   
5. **Phase 5: Legacy Script Deprecation**
   - Once the new workflow is proven, deprecate bin/build
   - Provide migration documentation for existing users

## FAQs

### Will I need to upload my keystore to use Fastlane?
No. Fastlane is designed to work with local signing keys. Your Android keystore and iOS certificates remain on your machine.

### Can I automate app store submissions without sharing my signing keys?
Yes. App store submissions can be automated using app-specific passwords (Apple) and API keys (Google Play), which are separate from signing credentials.

### Is Xcode UI necessary for iOS builds and submissions?
No. With Fastlane, the entire process can be automated via command line, including builds, signing, and App Store submission.

### What will happen to bin/build?
We recommend phasing out bin/build entirely in favor of direct Fastlane usage through npm scripts. The existing SCP deployment functionality to mychips.org will be reimplemented as a Fastlane lane. This approach eliminates an unnecessary abstraction layer and leverages Fastlane's full capabilities.

## Implementation Checklist and Progress

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks
1. ‚úÖ Install Fastlane (`brew install fastlane`)
2. ‚úÖ Create basic Fastlane configuration for Android and iOS
3. ‚úÖ Define essential build and deployment lanes in Fastfiles
4. ‚úÖ Update package.json with npm scripts for Fastlane lanes
5. ‚úÖ Create draft README documentation

### Implementation Status

**Current Version:** 0.2.0 (Updated due to React Native version upgrade)

**Current Implementation:**
- Fastlane has been set up and tested for both Android and iOS
- All build and deployment lanes have been created and verified
- Versioning is managed through npm scripts using react-native-version
- Deployment scripts automatically increment build numbers before deployment
- Android APK and Bundle builds have been tested and verified
- Android Play Store deployment successfully tested
- iOS TestFlight deployment successfully tested
- App Store deployment lane created but not yet tested
- All iOS lanes configured for "MyCHIPs" provisioning profile with Associated Domains capability

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Simplified approach with clear separation of concerns:
  - Versioning handled by npm scripts (using react-native-version)
  - Building and deployment handled by Fastlane
  - No duplication of versioning logic in Fastlane
- Manual semantic versioning in package.json
- Automatic build number increments before deployment
- Direct Fastlane usage through npm scripts rather than maintaining bin/build
- App Store Connect API key authentication using global configuration

**File Structure:**
- `/android/fastlane/`: Android Fastlane configuration
- `/ios/fastlane/`: iOS Fastlane configuration
- Package.json scripts connect these systems together

## Implemented Approach

### Versioning Strategy
- Manual semantic versioning in package.json (e.g., 0.2.0)
- Automatic build number increments via react-native-version
- Build numbers are incremented before deployment
- Clear separation between semantic versioning and build numbers

### Build Process
- Fastlane manages all builds
- Separate lanes for different build targets:
  - Android: APK and App Bundle
  - iOS: Archive, TestFlight, and App Store
- Build scripts in package.json provide easy access to Fastlane lanes

### Deployment Process
- Deployment scripts automatically:
  1. Increment build numbers
  2. Build the appropriate artifact
  3. Deploy to the specified target
- Environment variables control deployment destinations

### Environment Variables
- `MYCHIPS_ANDROID_APK_DEPLOY`: SCP destination for Android APKs
- iOS deployment requires Apple Developer credentials

## Documentation Updates Needed
- Update README.md with comprehensive information:
  - Add complete prerequisites section:
    - Node.js, npm/yarn version requirements
    - Xcode and Android Studio installation and configuration
    - Java/Gradle requirements for Android
    - Ruby and Fastlane installation instructions (`brew install fastlane` recommended)
    - Required environment variables and signing setup
  - Expand development environment setup:
    - Testing environment configuration
    - Development workflow best practices
    - Debugging tools and approaches
  - Create detailed build and deployment section:
    - Development builds vs production builds
    - Step-by-step deployment process for each platform and target
    - Clear description of npm script commands for various build/deploy targets
    - Keystore and signing certificate management
  - Add troubleshooting section for common issues:
    - Build failures and their solutions
    - Signing and certificate problems
    - Deployment rejections and resolutions
