## Background

The MyCHIPs mobile application displays financial information in various places, including tally lists, chit histories, and detail screens. We need to improve the consistency, readability, and functionality of these displays.

## Current Problems

1. **Inconsistent Value Display**: Different screens format and display CHIP values differently
2. **Inefficient Chit History**: Chit history shows settings chits and lacks options for sorting/filtering
3. **Manual Unit Conversion**: Many components manually convert between units and chips (dividing by 1000)
4. **Running Balance Issues**: Running balance display needs improvement in chit history
5. **Verbose UI Text**: Too much explanatory text clutters the UI in some screens

## Implementation Goals

1. Create standardized components for displaying CHIP values:
   - Consistent formatting with exactly 3 decimal places
   - Visual distinction between integer and decimal parts
   - Scalable for different screen contexts

2. Improve chit history display:
   - Filter out settings chits
   - Toggle sorting order
   - Show essential information only
   - Cleaner UI with better visual hierarchy

3. Standardize unit/chip conversions:
   - Use utility functions consistently (`unitsToChips`, `chipsToUnits`)
   - Ensure proper formatting with `formatChipValue` or `unitsToFormattedChips`

4. Fix running balance calculation and display:
   - Ensure accuracy in chit history
   - Consistent formatting with other CHIP values

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Standardized Conversion Utilities
1. Create/enhance utility functions for consistent value handling
2. Audit and update code to use these functions instead of manual calculations
3. Ensure all UI components display values consistently

### Phase 2: Chit History Improvements
1. Filter out settings chits from history view
2. Enhance chit item display for clarity and usability
3. Add sorting controls for different display orders
4. Fix running balance calculation and display

### Phase 3: Standardized CHIP Display Component
1. Create reusable component for displaying CHIP values
2. Style with underlined milliCHIPs for visual distinction
3. Support different sizes and contexts
4. Replace existing display patterns with the new component

   - Optimize performance for large chit histories

## Home Screen Sorting Enhancement Plan

### Current Issues
- The "Tally Order" filter is hard-coded and uses a separate FilterTallyList screen
- Limited sorting capabilities (recent, ascending/descending balance, absolute balance, alphabetical)
- Space constraints in the current layout make it difficult to add more sorting options
- Inconsistent UI patterns between Home screen and ChitHistory screen

### Proposed Solution
1. **Layout Reorganization**
   - Move the Grand Total up next to the avatar and user name
   - Free up space for a row of sorter widgets
   - Design a more efficient use of space

2. **Sorting Controls Implementation**
   - Replace current filter with multiple sorting widgets using the same pattern as ChitHistory
   - Implement three independent sorters:
     1. **Name Sorter** (left): Sort alphabetically by partner name (ascending/descending)
     2. **Date Sorter** (middle): Sort by modification date (most/least recent)
     3. **Balance Sorter** (right): Sort by tally total (ascending/descending/absolute)

3. **Redux Integration**
   - Create a dedicated tallySortSlice for persisting sort preferences
   - Store individual sort states and active sorter
   - Ensure persistence across app sessions
   - Each sorter should toggle between ascending/descending states
   - Implement mechanisms for displaying the active sorter

4. **Implementation Checklist**
   - [✅] Redesign Home screen layout
     - [✅] Move Grand Total to header area next to avatar
     - [✅] Create space for sorter row
     - [✅] Reduce spacing between UI elements for better space utilization
     - [✅] Ensure responsive design on different screen sizes
   - [✅] Implement sorter components
     - [✅] Create Name Sorter widget (left)
     - [✅] Create Date Sorter widget (middle)
     - [✅] Create Balance Sorter widget (right)
     - [✅] Implement UI for indicating active sorter
     - [✅] Connect sorters to actual sorting functionality:
     - [✅] Name sorter should toggle between alphabetical ascending/descending
     - [✅] Date sorter should toggle between newest first/oldest first
     - [✅] Balance sorter should cycle through: largest positive first → smallest positive first → absolute value (magnitude)
   - [✅] Implement Redux integration
     - [✅] Create tallySortSlice for sort state with following structure:
       ```javascript
       {
         activeSorter: "name" | "date" | "balance", // Currently active sorter
         nameSort: {
           direction: "asc" | "desc",
           field: "part_cert", // Field to sort by
         },
         dateSort: {
           direction: "asc" | "desc",
           field: "tally_date", // Field to sort by
         },
         balanceSort: {
           direction: "asc" | "desc" | "abs", // abs = absolute value
           field: "net", // Field to sort by
         }
       }
       ```
     - [✅] Connect components to Redux
     - [✅] Migrate existing sort functionality
     - [✅] Create selectors for computed sorted data
   - [🔄] Remove obsolete code
     - [✅] Clean up FilterTallyList screen
     - [✅] Update related navigation code
     - [ ] Remove old sorting implementation in profileSlice.js (separate PR task)

5. **Technical Considerations**
   - Ensure compatibility with existing code
   - Maintain sorting performance for large tally lists
   - Consider tablet and smaller phone displays
   - Keep internationalization support for sort labels
   - Evaluate potential impacts on pull-to-refresh and FlatList performance
   
6. **Implementation Details**
   - Create a new file src/redux/tallySortSlice.js
   - Modify src/screens/Tally/Banner/index.jsx to use new sort widgets
   - Update the sorter icons to reflect current sort state:
     - Name sorter: sort-alpha-asc ↔ sort-alpha-desc
     - Date sorter: sort-amount-desc ↔ sort-amount-asc
     - Balance sorter: sort-numeric-desc → sort-numeric-asc → calculator (for absolute)
   - Highlight active sorter with different background color
   - Utilize existing sort functions but connect to new Redux state
   - Add action creators for toggling each sorter
   - Use useMemo for memoizing sorted results based on active sort criteria

## Feedback and Refinements

### Existing Design Patterns Analysis

#### Home Screen & Working Tallies Implementation
- **CHIP Value Display**:
  - Split display pattern: integer portion in larger font, decimal portion underlined in smaller font
  - Color coding: green for positive values, red for negative
  - Currency conversion display in smaller font above CHIP values
  - ChitIcon component used as a visual indicator

- **Sorting/Filtering**:
  - State-based sorting using Redux (filterTally in profileSlice)
  - Sort options: Recent, Ascending/Descending Balance, Absolute Balance, Alphabetical
  - Filter selection UI with SelectedIcon/UnSelectedIcon for visual feedback
  - Persistent filter settings using AsyncStorage

- **UI Components**:
  - FlatList with custom renderItem functions
  - Pull-to-refresh functionality
  - Empty state handling
  - Consistent spacing, padding, and visual hierarchy

#### Utility Functions
- `unitsToChips` and `chipsToUnits` for conversion
- `formatChipValue` for consistent 3-decimal formatting
- `unitsToFormattedChips` for one-step conversion and formatting
- `getIntegerValue` and `getDecimalValue` for styled display

### Additional Goals
1. **Create a Standardized CHIP Value Display Component**:
   - Extract the pattern from TallyItem/Banner into a reusable component
   - Support different sizes for different contexts
   - Consistent styling (large CHIPs, underlined milliCHIPs)
   - Include optional currency conversion display
   - Support color coding based on value sign
   - Simplify with internal currency conversion to reduce prop passing

2. **Remodel Chit History Display**:
   - Use the standardized CHIP component for all value displays
   - Add ordering options (date, amount, type)
   - Implement filtering capability (type, date range)
   - Fix running balance calculation and display
   - Apply consistent visual hierarchy
