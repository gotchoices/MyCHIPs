# Tally Validity and Verification Implementation

*Last updated: April 5, 2025*

## Background

The MyCHIPs platform uses cryptographic signatures to ensure the validity and integrity of tallies and chits. When tallies are created, each user adds their public signing key to the tally (in the certificate property), and when both parties have signed a common version, the tally is considered valid. During development and testing, some tallies have been created without valid keys or signatures, and in some cases, users have lost or regenerated their signing keys.

Currently, the application does not verify the cryptographic validity of tallies and chits when they are loaded from the backend. The database contains a field (typically called 'json' or 'json_core') that holds the exact data that was signed, making it possible to verify signatures in the client application.

## Current Problems

1. **No Validity Verification**: The app doesn't verify signatures on tallies or chits when loading them
2. **Key Mismatch Detection**: No warning when a tally was signed with a different key than currently loaded
3. **Chit Chain Integrity**: No verification of the chit hash chain integrity
4. **Missing UI Indicators**: No visual indicators for different validity states

## Implementation Goals

1. Add two separate verification checks for tallies and chits:
   - **Signature Validity**: Verify if the signature is cryptographically valid
   - **Key Match**: Check if the key used matches the user's current active key

2. Display validity status in the UI:
   - Green check: Valid signature with matching key
   - Yellow warning: Valid signature but key mismatch (signed with old/different key)
   - Red warning: Invalid signature (missing key, missing signature, or failed verification)

3. Show detailed validity information in tally and chit detail screens
4. Verify chit hash chain integrity
5. Create a debug utility for re-signing tallies and chits (for testing only)

## Technical Details

### Tally Structure
- Tallies contain public keys in certificate properties
- Each party signs the tally's JSON representation
- The signature is stored in the database

### Chit Chain Structure
- The tally acts as "block zero" in a hash chain
- Each chit is like a block containing:
  - `chain_prev`: Digest of the prior block
  - `chain_idx`: Sequential number in the hash chain
  - `chain_dgst`: Hash of the chit's content
- As trading partners reach consensus, chits are assigned matching chain_idx values
- The final chain_dgst represents a checksum of the entire tally history

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Verification Implementation (Core Functionality)
1. Add json/json_core fields to existing tally and chit queries
2. Create verification utility functions in a dedicated module:
   - **isSignatureValid**: Verify if a tally/chit has a cryptographically valid signature
   - **isKeyMatch**: Check if the key used matches the user's current key
   - **getVerificationStatus**: Return both validity and key match status
   - Chit hash chain verification

### Phase 2: Basic UI Integration (Home Screen)
1. Create reusable `ValidityIndicator` component with different states:
   - Valid signature + matching key (green)
   - Valid signature + mismatched key (yellow)
   - Invalid signature (red)
2. Add these indicators to tally items in the home screen
3. Keep the implementation non-disruptive to existing functionality

### Phase 3: Detailed View Integration
1. Add validity details section to tally view screens:
   - Show both signature validity and key match status
   - Provide explanation of what each status means
   - Add action buttons based on status (e.g., re-sign if key mismatch)
2. Implement similar indicators for chit history screen
3. Add chain integrity visualization to chit detail screens

### Phase 4: Testing and Debug Tools (Optional)
1. Create specialized functions for re-signing tallies and chits
2. Implement backend support for re-signing operations
3. Add a debug-only interface for performing these operations

## Implementation Plan

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Initial analysis of the required changes
- Created tally verification utility (src/utils/tally-verification.js)
- Initial testing of verification with real tallies
- Created a test analyzer for deeper debugging (src/utils/tally-test.js)

### ‚úÖ Implemented
- Added warning icons to the Home screen's tally display
- Added proper Redux integration for tally validation statuses
- Implemented separate updataTallySlice for storing validation statuses
- Fixed reactivity issues with asyncronous validation and UI updates
- Ensured validation results persist through app state updates
- Made warning indicators show only for tallies with actual issues
- Added repair buttons for certificates and signatures with invalid status
- Created a dedicated utility file (src/utils/tally-repair.js) for repair functions
- Fixed API calls to backend for repair operations
- Reorganized the TallyEditView to group related information logically
- Improved certificate display with cleaner formatting and better readability
- Added section dividers to improve visual organization
- Implemented sophisticated validation hierarchy:
  - Signature repair requires a valid certificate with a matching key
  - Different informative messages based on certificate status
  - Asynchronously checks if tally's public key matches user's current key

### ‚úÖ Completed Work (Tally Validation)

We have successfully implemented:
- Proper Redux integration for tally validation

- Fixed communication with backend for repair operations
- Improved UI organization and presentation for certificates and signatures
- Added public key validation to certificate detail screen
- Made certificate images display in rectangular format for document context
- Created comprehensive documentation for disabling/removing repair functionality

### ‚úÖ Completed Dependencies Between Validations
- ‚úÖ Disabled signature repair button if certificate is invalid or if the key doesn't match
- ‚úÖ Added context-specific messages about fixing certificate first:
  - "Certificate must be fixed before signature can be repaired" (missing certificate key)
  - "Update certificate with current key before re-signing" (certificate key doesn't match current key)

### ‚úÖ Tooltip and Warning Integration
- ‚úÖ Added tooltip support when hovering over warning icons
- ‚úÖ Used existing language tags 'nocert', 'nosig', and 'diffkey' from tallies_v_me
- ‚úÖ Made ValidityIcon into a more reusable component with configurable message source

### ‚è≥ Future: Chit Validation Implementation
- Apply similar validation pattern to chits
- Add verification functions for chit signatures
- Add validation for hash chain integrity
- Update ChitHistory UI to show validation status
- Update ChitDetail screen to display validation information

### ‚è≥ Future: Backend Repair Functionality
- Implement repair functions in backend
- Ensure async messages coming back are handled correctly for tally updates in Redux
- Test having both partners re-validate an existing, invalid tally

# Future Work

5. Create testing scenarios for all validation states:
   - Contrive and test a situation with a matching key but corrupted/missing signature
   - Verify that validation correctly identifies these edge cases
   - Ensure the UI correctly displays appropriate repair options

6. Add testing:
   - Create unit tests for validation functions
   - Test with different tally scenarios (valid, invalid, key mismatch)
   - Manual testing with real-world tallies

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test verification functions with known good/bad signatures
   - Test key comparison with matching/non-matching keys
   - Test chain verification with valid/invalid chains

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test with tallies in various states of validity
   - Test UI components with different validity states

3. **End-to-End Testing**:
   - Verify correct behavior across the application workflow
   - Test re-signing functionality in isolation

## Lessons from Initial Analysis

Our code review revealed that the application:
1. Signs tallies using json-stable-stringify on the tally's json_core
2. Verifies public keys match before signing
3. Has crypto utilities already in place that can be leveraged
4. Uses the backend-provided digest values rather than computing them locally

## Backend Data Investigation

We queried the backend database to understand what the tally data looks like, specifically focusing on json_core, hold_cert, and hold_sig fields:

### Investigation Method
```bash
ssh admin@mychips.net "psql mychips admin -c \"select json_core,hold_cert,hold_sig from mychips.tallies_v where tally_ent = 'p1004' and tally_seq = 46\""
```

### Key Findings

1. **Tally Structure**:
   - A tally has two sides: a "foil" and a "stock"
   - Each partner holds one side of the tally
   - The `hold_cert` field always represents the certificate of the current user (holder)
   - The `hold_cert` will match either the "foil.cert" or "stock.cert" in json_core, depending on which side the user holds
   - `tally_type` indicates whether the user holds the "foil" or "stock" side

2. **Valid Tallies (tally_seq = 46)**:
   - json_core contains complete tally data with both foil and stock certificates
   - Each certificate contains a public key needed for signature verification:
     ```json
     "public": {
       "x": "AIqSU6Rr1LXSQiT8ZGFJI95bwjixiqm_rkICtLRn1pGaXgAJyh0CuTYeYG8xM2DJtDu_nJuaFhOvrd26Ya-9cIAV",
       "y": "AUeB9P-7RfnNzv-UhD6iO7TN1S_SnGY3gA5a83cwJopLQ2o0q5bYajUtrUQekWRtFJhFHdyWbq04JwXJ9xbprH9n",
       "crv": "P-521",
       "ext": true,
       "kty": "EC",
       "key_ops": ["verify"]
     }
     ```
   - hold_sig contains a cryptographic signature of the json_core

3. **Different Signature Tallies (tally_seq = 42)**:
   - Similar structure but with a different public key and signature
   - Shows that verification must handle different keys

4. **Tallies Without Keys (tally_seq = 14)**:
   - public key is null in both json_core and hold_cert
   - hold_sig contains the string "Valid" rather than a cryptographic signature
   - These tallies need special handling in our verification logic

   - [‚úÖ] Document how to remove and/or selectively disable repair functionality in the future (see section below)
   - [‚úÖ] **Note: Certificate detail screen improvements moved to [tally_display.md](tally_display.md)**

### Disabling or Removing Repair Functionality
The tally repair functionality has been designed with modularity in mind and can be disabled or removed using the following approaches:

1. **Complete Removal**:
   - Delete the `src/utils/tally-repair.js` utility file
   - Remove the repair button handlers from the `TallyEditView` component
   - Remove the `onRepair` and `onReSign` props from relevant components

2. **Selective Disabling via Configuration**:
   - Add a configuration flag in `src/config/constants.js`:
     ```javascript
     export const features = {
       ENABLE_TALLY_REPAIR: false,
     };
     ```
   - Modify the repair utility functions to check this flag:
     ```javascript
     export const reassertCertificate = (wm, tally_seq) => {
       if (!features.ENABLE_TALLY_REPAIR) return Promise.reject(new Error('Repair functionality disabled'));
       // Existing code...
     }
     ```
   - Conditionally render repair buttons based on the flag:
     ```jsx
     {validityStatus !== 'valid' && onRepair && features.ENABLE_TALLY_REPAIR && (
       <TouchableOpacity onPress={onRepair} style={styles.repairButton}>
         <FontAwesome name="wrench" size={10} color={colors.white} />
       </TouchableOpacity>
     )}
     ```

3. **Environment-Based Control**:
   - Make repair functionality available only in development builds:
     ```javascript
     export const features = {
       ENABLE_TALLY_REPAIR: __DEV__, // true in development, false in production
     };
     ```

4. **Role-Based Access**:
   - Only show repair options to users with admin/developer privileges
   - Requires backend to provide role information with user data
   - Update UI conditionally based on user role:
     ```jsx
     {validityStatus !== 'valid' && onRepair && (user.role === 'admin' || user.role === 'developer') && (
       <TouchableOpacity onPress={onRepair} style={styles.repairButton}>
         <FontAwesome name="wrench" size={10} color={colors.white} />
       </TouchableOpacity>
     )}
     ```

### Backend Communication Fixes
- Fixed an issue with the API calls for repair operations:
  - Initial implementation used incorrect format (`execute` action with `proc` parameter)
  - Updated to match codebase conventions (`select` action with `table` parameter)
  - Added proper `view` property to provide context to the backend
  - Both `reassertCertificate` and `reassertSignature` functions now follow consistent patterns

#### Final API Format (for reference)
```javascript
// Correct format for calling stored procedures
export const reassertCertificate = (wm, tally_seq) => {
  const spec = {
    view: 'mychips.tallies_v_me',
    table: 'mychips.reassert_cert',
    params: [tally_seq],
  }

  return request(wm, '_reassert_cert_' + random(), 'select', spec);
}
```

This matches the pattern used elsewhere in the codebase for calling stored procedures, particularly in user.js with the `base.curr_eid()` function.

### Notes from Analysis
- TallyEditView is the shared component behind all tally views
- Open tallies in EditOpenTally component are read-only (canEdit = false)
- The component has conditional rendering based on tally state that determines if fields can be edited

### Code Organization Note
- There seems to be an unclear distinction between 'utils' and 'services' folders
- Database calls are distributed across both folders
- Consider reviewing and standardizing this organization in a future issue
- A clear guideline would help with proper placement of new functionality

### UI Improvements for Next Phase
- Reorganize Tally Edit View layout:
  - Group certificates and signatures in a single "Security" or "Verification" section
  - Use collapsible sections for detailed information
  - Make certificate and signature fields properly truncated with ability to expand
  - Improve mobile-friendliness of the layout
  - Consider adding direct access to key management from repair screens
- Review TallyReview screen:
  - Ensure validity indicators are consistently applied
  - Verify proper display of certificate and signature information
  - Consider adding a dedicated "Verification Status" section
- Improve user feedback:
  - Add more descriptive tooltips explaining validation issues
  - Provide clearer guidance on how to resolve validation problems
  - Consider adding a help screen specifically for understanding tally validation
  
- Enforce proper validation hierarchy:
  - Disable signature repair button if certificate is invalid
  - Display informative message explaining that certificate must be fixed first
  - Add sequential repair guidance in tooltips
  - Consider adding a "Fix All" option that handles all repairs in the correct order
  
### Disabling or Removing Repair Functionality
- The repair functionality has been designed for modularity and can be disabled or removed:
  1. **Complete Removal**: Delete the `tally-repair.js` utility file and remove the button handlers from `TallyEditView` component
  2. **Selective Disabling**: 
     - Add a configuration flag in `constants.js` (e.g., `ENABLE_TALLY_REPAIR: false`)
     - Modify the `tally-repair.js` utilities to check this flag before proceeding
     - For feature-flagging, wrap repair buttons in conditional rendering based on the flag
  3. **Environment-Based Control**:
     - Add an environment check to disable in production but enable in development
     - Use a server-provided capability flag to control visibility
  4. **Role-Based Access**:
     - Only show repair options to users with admin/developer roles
     - Backend would need to provide role information
