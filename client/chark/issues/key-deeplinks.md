# Signing Key Deep Link Implementation

## Issue Description
Currently, MyCHIPs mobile app only supports exporting signing keys in JSON format. While this method works for backups and some key transfers, we need to implement deep link support for sharing signing keys between devices as specified in the external formats documentation.

## Background
The deep-linking.md file outlines the implementation of various deep link formats for the MyCHIPs app. According to the `learn-message.md` documentation, signing keys should support both JSON and deep link URL formats:

```
Encrypted (standard):
LINK: 'https://mychips.org/signkey?s=...,i=...,d=...'
LINK: 'https://mychips.org/signkey?base64EncodedJSON'
JSON:
{
  signkey: {
    s: SALT,
    i: INITIALIZATION_VECTOR,
    d: ENCRYPTED_DATA (should decrypt to serialized JWK key)
  }
}
```

The app already has a solid key export implementation that handles:
- JSON file export (with proper encryption)
- QR code generation for the exported data
- Sharing functionality via the device's native sharing capabilities

However, the deep link format is not yet generated or properly handled when scanning.

## Use Cases

1. **Email Transfer**
   - User wants to email the key to themselves
   - QR code should be included in the email for scanning from another device
   - Deep link in the email enables direct import when clicked on mobile

2. **Physical Backup**
   - User wants to print the key on paper for secure offline storage
   - QR code is the primary element needed for this case
   - Some human-readable information for context is helpful

3. **Password Manager Storage**
   - User wants to copy the deep link and store it in a password manager app
   - Clean, copyable text format is required

4. **Text Message Transfer**
   - User wants to text the key to another device
   - Deep link is the most important element for this use case

5. **File System Backup**
   - User wants to download the JSON file (Android)
   - User wants to share the file to local storage app (iOS)
   - For transfer to SD cards or manual device transfer

## Proposed Implementation

### UI Design for Export Screen

```

|     |                          |                 |
|     +--------------------------+                 |

|     https://mychips.org/signkey?  [Copy icon]    |
|                                                  |
|   File: [eyeball icon] (when disabled)           |
|                                                  |
+--------------------------------------------------+
|                                                  |
|   File: [eyeball icon] (when enabled)            |
|                                                  |
|     +--------------------------+                 |
|     | Textbox showing encrypted|  [Share icon]   | (ios only)
|     | key as JSON              |  [Download icon]| (android only)
|     +--------------------------+                 |
|                                                  |
+--------------------------------------------------+
```

The UI design uses minimal text and leverages existing icons for actions:
- QR code section is prominently displayed at the top for the most common use case
- URL display with copy icon for password manager and text message sharing
- File section is collapsible with an eyeball toggle to show/hide the advanced option
- Platform-specific actions (Share for iOS, Download for Android) are shown appropriately

   - Add URL length check and automatic format selection

2. **UI Components**
   - Used existing app components where possible:
     - ShareIcon from SvgAssets (enhanced with platform-specific rendering)
     - FontAwesome for copy icon
     - EyeIcon SVG for toggle
   - The collapsible JSON section preserves screen real estate
   - Made JSON text scrollable and selectable with black text on white background

3. **Deep Link Configuration**

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Export Implementation ‚úÖ
- Implemented key export functionality with URL format
- Added QR code generation for the exported signing key
- Implemented clipboard functionality for deep links
- Enhanced sharing capabilities for both QR code and link text
- Added support for platform-specific actions

### Phase 2: Import Implementation ‚è≥
- Implemented deep link handling in Scanner and Home components
- Added support for routing signing key deep links to ImportKey component
- Rewrote ImportKey component to improve state management and handle deep links
- Fixed issues with concurrent processing and duplicate toasts
- Preserved the original file import functionality

### Current Status
- Export functionality is fully working
- Import from deep links works for the first attempt
- Currently addressing issue with subsequent deep link imports

### Technical Challenges Addressed
1. **Race Conditions in Redux Updates**: 
   - Fixed by rewriting ImportKey component to use refs for tracking state
   - Added proper state management to avoid duplicate Redux updates

2. **Duplicate Toasts**:
   - Resolved by improving the component lifecycle and state management
   - Used refs to prevent re-processing the same URLs

3. **Multiple Import Methods**:
   - Ensured the Import button always triggers file import flow
   - Deep links properly navigate to ImportKey component and show appropriate UI

4. **State Handling**:
   - Separated UI state from key data state
   - Introduced refs for tracking processed URLs to avoid render cycles
   - Improved error handling and cancellation

### Modified Files
- `/src/screens/Setting/GenerateKey/ExportModal/index.jsx` - Export UI
- `/src/screens/KeyManagement/ImportKey.jsx` - Import handling
- `/src/screens/KeyManagement/index.jsx` - Navigation processing
- `/src/screens/Scanner/index.jsx` - QR code handling
- `/src/screens/Home/index.jsx` - Deep link handling

### Remaining Tasks
1. **Fix Subsequent Deep Link Imports**:
   - Need to ensure `processedUrls` ref is properly cleared after import
   - Update deep link handling to work with multiple invocations
   - Potential solutions:
     - Move deep link processing from `useEffect` to component props or navigation events
     - Clear `processedUrls` after import and add a timeout to prevent immediate reprocessing
     - Implement a global deep link handler that passes clean props to ImportKey on each navigation

2. **Testing with Real Devices**:
   - Test on both iOS and Android physical devices
   - Verify handling of edge cases and malformed inputs
   - Ensure proper performance across different platforms

3. **URL Scheme Registration**:
   - Update App.js to properly register the "signkey" URL scheme
   - Update apple-app-site-association file for iOS Universal Links
   - Update assetlinks.json for Android App Links

4. **Advanced Features** (Future):
   - Implement base64-encoded JSON format for very large keys
   - Add automatic format selection based on key size
   - Enhance error handling for malformed deep links

5. **Documentation**:
   - Update documentation with the implemented deep link format
   - Add usage examples for developers

### Next Immediate Steps
1. Fix the issue with subsequent deep link imports:
   - The current implementation uses React refs to track processed URLs, but this state persists between navigation events
   - We need to either:
     - Reset the refs when the component unmounts AND when navigation changes
     - Move to a different approach that doesn't rely on persistent refs
     - Consider using React Navigation's focus/blur events to reset state
   
2. Test changes thoroughly with different scenarios:
   - Test importing the same key multiple times
   - Test importing different keys in sequence
   - Verify proper error handling with malformed links
   - Test interrupted imports (cancellation during import process)

3. Complete URL scheme registration in App.js and server configuration

### Future Code Refactoring (Phase 3)
After we've completed and validated the basic deep link functionality, we'll implement a consolidation phase:

1. **Create a `utils/deep-links.js` Utility File**:
   - Centralize deep link parsing logic in one utility file
   - Include common constants and patterns for all deep link types
   - Provide helper functions for parsing and validating URLs

2. **Preserve Existing Handler Implementations**:
   - Keep the existing handler logic in both Scanner and Home components 
   - Only move common parsing logic to the utility file
   - Preserve the unique handling code in each component

3. **Step-by-Step Refactoring**:
   - Implement changes one at a time with careful testing
   - Avoid rewriting handlers in a way that would break existing functionality
   - Use the utility file for new additions rather than rewriting existing code

4. **Benefits**:
   - Improved code organization and reusability
   - Easier maintenance and future extensions
   - Consistent URL parsing across the application
   - Cleaner component code with business logic separated from parsing logic

Note: This refactoring will be approached incrementally, with thorough testing at each step to ensure we don't reintroduce any of the issues we've already fixed.
