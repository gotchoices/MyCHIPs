# Signing Key Deep Link Implementation

## Issue Description
Currently, MyCHIPs mobile app only supports exporting signing keys in JSON format. While this method works for backups and some key transfers, we need to implement deep link support for sharing signing keys between devices as specified in the external formats documentation.

## Background
The deep-linking.md file outlines the implementation of various deep link formats for the MyCHIPs app. According to the `learn-message.md` documentation, signing keys should support both JSON and deep link URL formats:

```
Encrypted (standard):
LINK: 'https://mychips.org/signkey?s=...,i=...,d=...'
LINK: 'https://mychips.org/signkey?base64EncodedJSON'
JSON:
{
  signkey: {
    s: SALT,
    i: INITIALIZATION_VECTOR,
    d: ENCRYPTED_DATA (should decrypt to serialized JWK key)
  }
}
```

The app already has a solid key export implementation that handles:
- JSON file export (with proper encryption)
- QR code generation for the exported data
- Sharing functionality via the device's native sharing capabilities

However, the deep link format is not yet generated or properly handled when scanning.

## Use Cases

1. **Email Transfer**
   - User wants to email the key to themselves
   - QR code should be included in the email for scanning from another device
   - Deep link in the email enables direct import when clicked on mobile

2. **Physical Backup**
   - User wants to print the key on paper for secure offline storage
   - QR code is the primary element needed for this case
   - Some human-readable information for context is helpful

3. **Password Manager Storage**
   - User wants to copy the deep link and store it in a password manager app
   - Clean, copyable text format is required

4. **Text Message Transfer**
   - User wants to text the key to another device
   - Deep link is the most important element for this use case

5. **File System Backup**
   - User wants to download the JSON file (Android)
   - User wants to share the file to local storage app (iOS)
   - For transfer to SD cards or manual device transfer

## Proposed Implementation

### UI Design for Export Screen

```
+--------------------------------------------------+
|  Export                                     [X]  |
+--------------------------------------------------+
|                                                  |
|     +--------------------------+                 |
|     |                          |   [Share icon]  |
|     |       [QR CODE]          |                 |
|     |                          |                 |
|     +--------------------------+                 |
|                                                  |
|     https://mychips.org/signkey?  [Copy icon]    |
|                                                  |
|   File: [eyeball icon] (when disabled)           |
|                                                  |
+--------------------------------------------------+
|                                                  |
|   File: [eyeball icon] (when enabled)            |
|                                                  |
|     +--------------------------+                 |
|     | Textbox showing encrypted|  [Share icon]   | (ios only)
|     | key as JSON              |  [Download icon]| (android only)
|     +--------------------------+                 |
|                                                  |
+--------------------------------------------------+
```

The UI design uses minimal text and leverages existing icons for actions:
- QR code section is prominently displayed at the top for the most common use case
- URL display with copy icon for password manager and text message sharing
- File section is collapsible with an eyeball toggle to show/hide the advanced option
- Platform-specific actions (Share for iOS, Download for Android) are shown appropriately

- `/src/screens/KeyManagement/index.jsx` - Navigation processing
- `/src/screens/Scanner/index.jsx` - QR code handling
- `/src/screens/Home/index.jsx` - Deep link handling

### Current Code Implementation

1. **ImportKey Component**:
   ```javascript
   // Main changes to ImportKey component:
   const ImportKey = props => {
     // Using refs to track deep link processing state
     const isProcessingDeepLink = useRef(false);
     const processedUrls = useRef(new Set());
     
     // UI state and key data state separated
     const [uiState, setUiState] = useState({...});
     const [keyData, setKeyData] = useState({...});
     
     // Process URLs on component mount
     useEffect(() => {
       // Process signkey URL if available and not already processed
       const signkeyUrl = props.signkeyUrl || props.route?.params?.signkeyUrl;
       if (signkeyUrl && !processedUrls.current.has(signkeyUrl)) {
         processedUrls.current.add(signkeyUrl);
         isProcessingDeepLink.current = true;
         // Handle URL...
       }
       
       // Clean up refs on unmount
       return () => {
         isProcessingDeepLink.current = false;
         processedUrls.current.clear();
       };
     }, []);
     
     // Extract data from URL
     const extractKeyDataFromUrl = (url) => {
       // Parse URL parameters (s, i, d)
       // Return formatted JSON
     };
     
     // Store keys securely
     const storeKeys = async () => {
       // Update backend
       // Store in secure storage
       // Update Redux state
       // Reset component state
     };
   };
   ```

2. **Scanner Component**:
   ```javascript
   // Deep link handling in Scanner:
   else if (qrCode.startsWith(signkeyLink)) {
     // Currently missing UUID that other link types use
     props.navigation.navigate('Settings', {
       screen: 'KeyManagement',
       params: {
         signkeyUrl: qrCode,
         autoImport: true
       }
     });
   }
   ```

3. **Home Component**:
   ```javascript
   // Deep link handling in Home:
   else if(signkeyUri.has(host)) {
     // Also missing UUID for unique navigation
     props.navigation.navigate('Settings', {
       screen: 'KeyManagement',
       params: {
         signkeyUrl: url,
         autoImport: true
       }
     });
   }
   ```

### Implementation Insights

1. **Component Lifecycle**: Identified that the ImportKey component was not consistently remounting between deep link navigation events, which caused processing logic to run only once.

2. **State Persistence**: Discovered that React refs (`processedUrls.current`) persist across renders and remain populated even when navigation changes, preventing reprocessing of URLs.

3. **UUID Solution**: Implemented the same pattern used for other deep link types (payment, tally) that adds a random UUID to make each navigation unique, ensuring each URL is seen as new by React Navigation.

4. **ImportKey Improvements**: Modified the ImportKey component to respond to URL dependency changes instead of relying on component mounting, making it more robust for handling repeated deep links.

### Remaining Tasks
1. **Update Android App Links Configuration**: ‚úÖ
   - Added the `/signkey` path to the intent filter in Android's `AndroidManifest.xml`
   - Fixed issue where deep links weren't working on real Android devices
   - The full intent filter now properly includes all path patterns:

```xml
<!-- Updated in AndroidManifest.xml -->
<intent-filter android:autoVerify="true">
  <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
  <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
  <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
  <data android:scheme="https" />
  <data android:host="mychips.org" />
  <data android:pathPattern="/ticket" />
  <data android:pathPattern="/invite" />
  <data android:pathPattern="/pay" />
  <data android:pathPattern="/signkey" /> <!-- Added this line -->
</intent-filter>
```

2. **Testing on Real Devices**:
   - After updating AndroidManifest.xml, rebuild and reinstall the app
   - Verify App Links in Android Settings > Apps > [Your App] > Open by default
   - Test deep links via camera app and direct browser URLs
   - Check logcat output for any verification errors
   - Test on both iOS and Android physical devices
   - Verify handling of edge cases and malformed inputs
   - Ensure proper performance across different platforms

3. **Additional Information About assetlinks.json**:
   - The server's assetlinks.json file is correctly configured with:
     - Package name: "org.mychips.chark"
     - Proper SHA-256 certificate fingerprint
   - No changes needed to assetlinks.json since we're just adding a new path
   - The file establishes the relationship between domain and app, not individual paths

4. **Documentation**:
   - Add usage examples for developers
   - Document the implementation details in the project wiki

5. **Advanced Features** (Future):
   - Implement base64-encoded JSON format for very large keys
   - Add automatic format selection based on key size
   - Enhance error handling for malformed deep links

### Strategy for Fixing Subsequent Deep Link Imports

After analyzing the code and seeing the existing pattern in the app for handling recurring deep links, we have a clear solution:

1. **Use UUID Approach from Payment and Tally Links**:
   - We discovered that the Scanner component already has a reliable mechanism for handling repeated QR code scans
   - For payment links: `const payUrl = ${qrCode}&randomString=${uuid()};`
   - For tally invites: `const tallyInviteUrl = ${qrCode}&randomString=${uuid()};`
   - These add a random UUID to ensure each navigation is seen as unique

2. **Implementation Plan for Signkey Links**:
   ```javascript
   // In Scanner component
   else if (qrCode.startsWith(signkeyLink)) {
     // Add random UUID to ensure each scan is processed uniquely
     const uniqueSignkeyUrl = `${qrCode}&randomString=${uuid()}`;
     props.navigation.navigate('Settings', {
       screen: 'KeyManagement',
       params: {
         signkeyUrl: uniqueSignkeyUrl,
         autoImport: true
       }
     });
   }
   
   // Also update Home component similarly for clicked links
   else if (signkeyUri.has(host)) {
     const uniqueSignkeyUrl = `${url}&randomString=${uuid()}`;
     props.navigation.navigate('Settings', {
       screen: 'KeyManagement',
       params: {
         signkeyUrl: uniqueSignkeyUrl,
         autoImport: true
       }
     });
   }
   ```

3. **Simplify ImportKey Component**:
   - Remove all URL tracking via processedUrls - it's no longer needed
   - Keep a simple isProcessing flag to prevent concurrent operations
   - Process each incoming URL directly without checking if it's been seen before
   - Keep the effect dependency on the URL to ensure it runs when the URL changes

4. **Why This Works**:
   - The UUID ensures each navigation has a different URL parameter
   - React Navigation will see this as a new route, triggering effects with URL dependencies
   - Even if the component isn't unmounting, the effect will re-run with the new unique URL
   - This matches the existing pattern in the app that's working for other link types

5. **Advantages of This Approach**:
   - Follows established patterns in the existing codebase
   - Works regardless of navigation stack behavior
   - Simple to implement and maintain
   - Doesn't require complex state management

### Next Testing Steps
1. Implement the UUID approach for signkey links in both Scanner and Home components
2. Remove URL tracking in ImportKey, rely only on the URL dependency in useEffect
3. Test multiple deep link scenarios:
   - Same URL multiple times
   - Different URLs in sequence
   - Interrupted imports (cancellation)
   - Manual import between deep links

### Follow-up Tasks
1. Complete server configuration for the landing page on mychips.org

### Completed Code Refactoring (Phase 3) ‚úÖ
We've successfully implemented the consolidation phase:

1. **Created `utils/deep-links.js` Utility File**:
   - Centralized deep link parsing logic in one utility file
   - Included common constants and patterns for all deep link types
   - Provided helper functions for parsing, validating, and processing URLs:
     - `LINK_TYPES` and `LINK_PREFIXES` constants
     - `addUuidToUrl()` for adding unique identifiers to URLs
     - `extractPathType()` for determining link types
     - `parseSignkeyUrl()` for processing signkey URLs

2. **Updated Existing Components**:
   - Modified Scanner component to use our utility functions
   - Updated Home component to use centralized path extraction
   - Refactored ImportKey component to use shared URL parsing
   - Preserved the unique handling logic in each component

3. **Benefits Achieved**:
   - Improved code organization and reusability
   - Easier maintenance and future extensions
   - Consistent URL handling across the application
   - Reduced code duplication
   - Better separation of concerns between components

This refactoring was done incrementally and carefully, ensuring that all existing functionality continues to work while making the code more maintainable and easier to extend with new deep link types in the future.
