TODO:

Immediate:
X- npm docker works with node 16
X- docker simulation runs with node 16
- 
-   Modify schema:
X-     Each user references a single agent key
X-     Table for agent keys: cache current portal information
-     Automatically build default agent key
-     Default site agent key in parameter table?
-     Launch server with specific (or default) agent key and portal
-     How would admin normally assign agent keys to individual users?
-     PeerNoise publishes our correct portal to peers
-     Does simulation still work?
-   Modify mychips.js to select encrypted or raw modes
-   PeerNoise module reports peers who connect from non-matching portals
-   Modify simulation to invoke raw mode by default
-   Set encrypted as new server default
-   Simulation still runs OK (using default raw or encrypted)
- 
X- Extend Wyseman client side to communicate over websockets
- Extend Wyseman to receive connections on TCP socket?
- Make command-line user interface?
- Integrate DSR patches into simulation folder?
- 

General roadmap:
X- Public Proof-of-Concept release
X- Iterate on TLA+ modeling until protocol is sufficiently safe/live
X- Implement basic contract handling (author, display, print, publish)
- Integrate improved protocol into source code
- Write unit tests to validate protocol state transitions
- Improve/expand agent model (see below)
- Make Flutter app usable with basic functionality
- Implement digital signatures for tallies, chits, contracts, lifts
- Implement encrypted peer-to-peer communications using noise protocol
- Harden database schema, nothing accessible except user-based views/functions
- Finish schema version control/upgrade mechanism in wyseman
- Docker-based production server
- *** Production rollout ***
- Enhance flutter app features
- Async email/text notifications
- Tally confirmations
- Standardized export/import of user accounts via Admin interface

Some general tasks by level of expertise required (redundant)
- Low Level: (code validation)
-   Write unit tests, which become part of the integrated test suite. 
-     Test state transition graphs for all conceivable combinations of state.
-     Attempt to request multiple, conflicting state transitions at once.
-     Working retry/recovery of records that get stranded in a transitional state
- Medium Level: (network simulation)
X-   Implement peer communication channel based on "noise protocol" to replace current lib/peercomm.js module
C-   Write a more advanced agent model that reasonably simulates the choices an actual human would make when interacting with the system.
-   Examples include:  (where each character is randomly determined for individual agents)
-     Spending consumption costs at a regular rate
-     Luxury spending when more money is available
-     Being more or less of a saver
-     Accumulating varying amounts of foil-debit balances (savings bonds)
-     Getting a job when you are out of money
-     Finding other income sources
-     Acquiring capital assets (with and without associated debt)
-     Spending money with non-connected nodes (i.e. requesting linear lifts/drops)
-     Developing a reasonable number of downstream tally relationships (i.e. vendors)
-     Starting a credit certification aggregator (savings and loan)
-     Starting a vendor aggregator (credit card company)
- High Level: (architecture/design)
X-   Close security holes found by DSR study (implement arbiter into protocol?)
-   Implement improved lift protocol with referee nodes
-   Implement chit consensus protocol fully
-   Implement retries on all protocol levels
-   Add key signing/validation regimen to tally process
-   Add key signing/validation regimen to chit/lift process

- Tallies / Chit consensus:
- Which parameters are signed in the tally, which can be changed later?
- Implement what is documented in new protocol
- Can tolerate network outages
- Will re-synch chain no matter how many chits got added during outage
- Need ack/nak added to chit protocol?
- Ack/naks include chits and/or chain segments as applicable
?- Need to handle more than one lift per site with the same guid (when a lift passes through the same site more than once)
- Routes count how many successful lifts they have conveyed
- Routes refresh their expiration upon last successful lift
- Does it work to re-probe for an existing (expired, pending or failed) route?
- Need a scheduler to do this occasionally (and particularly when necessary)
- Create CRON-type schedule on server to call query/call lift functions on regular interval
?- Deleting a chit properly resets sequence counter in mychips.tallies?
?- Prevent deleting a chit in the middle of a valid chain
- Test/validate retry mechanism (tallies,chits,routes,lifts)
- Can I mark a chit as refused, some way other than text in the signature?
?- Do we need a real state variable in chits?
- Change to aborted state after max number of retries/time (peer.js)
- 

Server Refinements:
X- Show graphical view of all users connected via a set of specified SQL servers
- Noise protocol fully integrated
- Should server launch with fewer default behaviors?
- Can launch in encrypted or plaintext (for simulations) mode
- Test: can the server recover if the database goes down and back up?
- Test SSL connection to postgres
- 

- Structured Documents:
?- Generate a digest on publish
?- Lock the document on publish
- Build parameterized, local hyperlink from formal URL
- Export defaults to reasonable filename
- Contract json import works properly
- Files in contract folder are Real strdoc json format
- Bulk export action from dbp?
- When/how do people verify the hash?
- Integrate document server with SPA server? (or have separate static folder)

- Strdoc:
- Can I edit/author documents now?
- What if I import a document into strdoc and then try to update?  (Do an insert?)
- Make source field I can enable with a button; Turns off other fields
- Preview mode includes language to refer to the included document (in current language?)
- Implement a few basic contracts using strdoc widget
- Harden contract views so you can only update working contracts (test)
- Implement publish procedure in backend (share code between reports)
- Begin wyseman library of server-side query builder functions (that reports can use)
- How to serve my documents in HTML-viewable form if .html suffix given to web server
- Coded errors in wyseman.js get translated "badTuples" "badUpdate" etc

- Reports:
- Report windows fetch wm object/fields if/when needed from main (make strdoc work)
- Report windows implement optional control/parameter menu at top
- Strdoc and/or others put their menu next to the main control menu
- Reports have optional slave setting where they respond to key changes
- Auto update can be switched off in the report menu
- Reports have optional update setting where they can push data back to dbe and update database
- Strdoc now working good enough to build/edit MyCHIPs documents
- Implement document publish
- Published documents no longer writable
- Can reference documents within documents
- Do/can they print/render in-line or only separately?
- Can I query/fetch any document from any SPA (or peer?) server?
- Can I easily load them into my own database to keep a local mirror copy?
- I should have a copy of any contract referenced in any of my tallies (FK reference?)?
- Make tallies actually reference contracts existing in the DB


- Where to best put:
-   WyattERP Admin console
-   WyattERP User (all available functions in tabs)
-   Reports work in WyattERP
- 

User Agent2 process:
X- Learns about other peers through central repository
X- Some users are in same DB, others in a different one
- BUG: Some tallies being established twice with same peer
- What happens if a state transition fails due to contention?  Does it retry for success?
- Don't try to add same peer again to mychips.peers if we connect to him twice (add on conflict clause ?)
- Some chits are not getting beyond draft mode.  Why?
- Spend CHIPs with more sensitivity to current net worth (other factors)
- Seek/establish vendors, in addition to clients
- Honor max clients, max vendors parameters from DB
- Work harder if my accrued receivables get low  
- Raise vendor accumulation limits if my receivables get high
- Create lift incentives if I get stale imbalances
- Extend credit to peers based only on their credit-worthiness
-   Be more random on search for new client tally connection
-   Find a foil tally and pay some credits on it
-   Agent establishes reasonable number of tallies with other users
-   If I already have a tally with you, don't do another one
- Try installing/running with SL and NA
-   Fill in tally limits data for all users
-   Each agent pays his downstreamers periodically
- Fill in buy/sell orders data for all users (Can I derive this from existing tally limits)
- Develop state machine for data queries
-   Can you find a path to user X?
-   Store data about known pathways
- Develop state machine for lift execution
-   Would you participate in a lift destined for user X, for Y CHIPs?
X- Dummy sql to create initial draft tally
- Dummy sql files to simulate other required user actions
- User agent process runs randomized strategy
- 

DB/schema:
X- Change base.ent to make id, unique to ent_type
X- Make consolidated key target field: P100, A100, G100
X- Adjust all subordinate tables to point to the target field
- Test json tally import/export
- Only allow minimum, required access/permissions
- Can run equally well from schema source build, or from compiled schema build
- 

User initiated commands:
- Initiate tally with (peer)
- Send money to (peer)
- Send invoice to (peer)
- Set sell target of (issue)
- Set buy target for (issue)
- Get balance summary (date)
- Get income/expense summary (start, end)
- 

User SPA:
- Visual balance sheet
- Can generate, configure keys
- User can generate tickets for other peers
- Can register/update buy/sell parameters
- 

- Admin SPA:
X- Optimize SVG user graph reactivity.  Only update what has changed.
X- User can connect/initialize using ticket
- Server listens on ticket port for specified timeout period
- Enable user permission editor in admin app user tab
- Can export user to JSON
- Can export user to paper, w/ QR code
-  Admin can edit, create documents
-   

Wyseman:
- Can apply incremental delta scripts to go from one release to another
- Modify wyseman/lib/wyseman.js to also listen on regular unix socket for admin connections
- Regular socket connection relies solely on an auth key (key file, not keys stored in DB user tables)
- Use SNI extension for client to provide db config payload
- Is there any use case for a user connecting via regular socket? (native app?)
-   If so, socket connection needs to use connection tokens/keys just like websocket
- Make database owned by mychips? (give admin read/write/delete but not create/drop)
- Extend Wyseman to also accept connections on Noise socket?
- 

Preferences:
- App widget responsible for saving/restoring preference settings
- Other modules can supply their own prefs defaults until better DB metadata arrives
- Request wm Language object from app instead of direct from wyseman?
- Request pr object from app instead of from prefs?
- Make pdm option for fetching options from database via query (idx,title,help)
- Make standard shortcut for language (there will be others too)
- Can now select languages from prefs menu and app updates reactively
- Make standard shortcut for exists, given DB table, column
- 

Wylib:
- I get errors on reload when dbe and dbs both open on a dbp
- Implement default load column in views, wylib uses it if present
- Implement default order column in views, wylib uses it if present
- Update audit tables to store changes as JSON
X- Automatic reconnect retry working right
- Handle state changes correctly when connecting to new/different backend
X- Wylib login/validation for SPA client/server connections
- Wylib report
-   Can print from strdoc component
-   Can print out tally contract (with QR code paper backup)?
- Can export dbp view to a spreadsheet
- Report graphics (i.e. ticket) can export to graphic, attach to email, etc.
- Support for spreadsheet reports?
- Should we use a spreadsheet widget with file export?
X- Write wmd files for wyselib parameters
- Write wmd defaults for other wyselib/base files?
- Can launch actions from a dbp with multiple keys
- Should each tab have a menu that launches new previews, and can save/restore state?
-
