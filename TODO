- Can we serve user photos from the document server?
-  Add user photo (document) database table?
-  Include hash reference to photos in certificates

- User registration page refinements:
-  Email confirmation code, enter on page, rather than emailing link? (low priority)
-  Page Includes links to Android APK and Apple testflight
-  Can view terms of Service page?
-  Fix document server also running on 443 (request by hash?)
- 
- Chit consensus
-  Why is one chit still left in pending state after tests?
-  Update existing code to honor chain state (honor how?)
-    Only _process commands if in appropriate cstate?
-  Existing regression tests still work
-  Notify user (or admin?) when a consensus reached on a tally/chit?
-    So we don't have to timeout in tests
-  Commit
-  
- Make test for chits that cross in transit
-  Make adjustable delay before received chit processed
-  Test attempts a range of possible delays
-  
-  Stock can request arbitrary chain query message (is this needed?)
-  Stock requeues any stray chits found after upd packet
-  All regression tests pass
-  Comment out PG notices
-  Simulation still works
-  Commit/merge to master
-   
- Distributed lifts (interim, pre-1.0 functionality):
-  Distributed lifts work with model2/model3?
-  Do some lifts fail (when they should) in the simulation?
-  How do lift records get marked to void? (implement agent timeouts?)
-  Some routes are failing with invalid state (RZ)
- 
- Linear lifts:
-  Create draft lift record and retrieve digest
-  Sign the digest and write to DB
-  Trigger detects the new record
-   If we have an internal path to the destination, pay with local lift (simple)
-   Else, if we have a possible route, queue up as a distributed lift.
- 
- Chark App Integration:
-  Document method for debugging server certificate
-

-   All language data coming from backend
-   Populate second language (Nepali?)
-  Tally Initiation:
-   User can create draft tally
-   User can create multiple draft tallies
-   Draft tallies may contain different details, including user certificate
-   If tally is generated not from a draft, it uses default certificate data
-   User can generate tally invitations from draft or default
-   User can share tally invitation via text, email, scan, print, pdf, etc
-   User can share tallyinvitation as a QR or deep link
-  Tally recipient:

-   User can send unsolicited chit on any open tally
-   User can send payment request chit on any open tally
-   Users receive notification when chit is received
-   User can respond to received payment request chit
-   User can reject, modify, or accept payment request chit
- 
- 
- Misc Cleanups:
- Correctly assess lading on lift push through foreign tally (we now know parter's limit/bound)
-  Merge local null min with route lading correctly
-  Should all xxx_process functions return text or JSON (routes need JSON)?
-  Why do some routes get stuck in draft mode (See RZ notice)?
-  Should the "tally" property of a route message be in the message, not the object (since it should change at each hop)?
-  Ditto for "step" property of a route message
-  Mocha test for model2? (probably not right away)
-  Command to test-run docker simulator--just to see if any error messages pop out?
-  Can peer containers run with spa services disabled?

- Can only do future vesting for tran type (manual) chits
- Tally totals for calculating lifts include only present/past chits (not future)
- Additional total net_f field (future value)?
- Add regression test(s) for this feature
- 
- Implement retries in state processing (tally, chit, route)
- Upgrade distributed lift subsystem fully to protocol 1.0
- Lifts detected bad by agent timeouts
- Implement referee server in node server

Some general tasks by level of expertise required (redundant)
- Low Level: (code validation)
*-   Write unit tests, which become part of the integrated test suite. 
*-     Test state transition graphs for all conceivable combinations of state.
-     Attempt to request multiple, conflicting state transitions at once.
-     Working retry/recovery of records that get stranded in a transitional state
- Medium Level: (network simulation)
X-   Implement peer communication channel based on "noise protocol" to replace current lib/peercomm.js module
C-   Write a more advanced agent model that reasonably simulates the choices an actual human would make when interacting with the system.
-   Examples include:  (where each character is randomly determined for individual agents)
-     Spending consumption costs at a regular rate
-     Luxury spending when more money is available
-     Being more or less of a saver
-     Accumulating varying amounts of foil-debit balances (savings bonds)
-     Getting a job when you are out of money
-     Finding other income sources
-     Acquiring capital assets (with and without associated debt)
-     Spending money with non-connected nodes (i.e. requesting linear lifts/drops)
-     Developing a reasonable number of downstream tally relationships (i.e. vendors)
-     Starting a credit certification aggregator (savings and loan)
-     Starting a vendor aggregator (credit card company)
- High Level: (architecture/design)
X-   Close security holes found by DSR study (implement arbiter into protocol?)
-   Implement improved lift protocol with referee nodes
-   Implement chit consensus protocol fully
-   Implement retries on all protocol levels
-   Add key signing/validation regimen to tally process
-   Add key signing/validation regimen to chit/lift process

- Tallies / Chit consensus:
- Which parameters are signed in the tally, which can be changed later?
- Implement what is documented in new protocol
- Can tolerate network outages
- Will re-synch chain no matter how many chits got added during outage
- Need ack/nak added to chit protocol?
- Ack/naks include chits and/or chain segments as applicable
?- Need to handle more than one lift per site with the same guid (when a lift passes through the same site more than once)
- Routes count how many successful lifts they have conveyed
- Routes refresh their expiration upon last successful lift
- Does it work to re-probe for an existing (expired, pending or failed) route?
- Need a scheduler to do this occasionally (and particularly when necessary)
- Create CRON-type schedule on server to call query/call lift functions on regular interval
?- Deleting a chit properly resets sequence counter in mychips.tallies?
?- Prevent deleting a chit in the middle of a valid chain
- Test/validate retry mechanism (tallies,chits,routes,lifts)
- Can I mark a chit as refused, some way other than text in the signature?
?- Do we need a real state variable in chits?
- Change to aborted state after max number of retries/time (peer.js)
- 

Server Refinements:
X- Show graphical view of all users connected via a set of specified SQL servers
- Noise protocol fully integrated
- Should server launch with fewer default behaviors?
- Can launch in encrypted or plaintext (for simulations) mode

- Implement a few basic contracts using strdoc widget
- Harden contract views so you can only update working contracts (test)
- Implement publish procedure in backend (share code between reports)
- Begin wyseman library of server-side query builder functions (that reports can use)
- How to serve my documents in HTML-viewable form if .html suffix given to web server

- Make tallies actually reference contracts existing in the DB


- Where to best put:
-   WyattERP Admin console
-   WyattERP User (all available functions in tabs)
-   Reports work in WyattERP
- 

User Agent2 process:
X- Learns about other peers through central repository
X- Some users are in same DB, others in a different one
- BUG: Some tallies being established twice with same peer
- What happens if a state transition fails due to contention?  Does it retry for success?
- Don't try to add same peer again to mychips.peers if we connect to him twice (add on conflict clause ?)
- Some chits are not getting beyond draft mode.  Why?
- Spend CHIPs with more sensitivity to current net worth (other factors)
- Seek/establish vendors, in addition to clients
- Honor max clients, max vendors parameters from DB
- Work harder if my accrued receivables get low  
- Raise vendor accumulation limits if my receivables get high
- Create lift incentives if I get stale imbalances
- Extend credit to peers based only on their credit-worthiness
-   Be more random on search for new client tally connection
-   Find a foil tally and pay some credits on it
-   Agent establishes reasonable number of tallies with other users
-   If I already have a tally with you, don't do another one
- Try installing/running with SL and NA
-   Fill in tally limits data for all users
-   Each agent pays his downstreamers periodically
- Fill in buy/sell orders data for all users (Can I derive this from existing tally limits)
- Develop state machine for data queries
-   Can you find a path to user X?
-   Store data about known pathways
- Develop state machine for lift execution
-   Would you participate in a lift destined for user X, for Y CHIPs?
X- Dummy sql to create initial draft tally
- Dummy sql files to simulate other required user actions
- User agent process runs randomized strategy
- 

DB/schema:
X- Change base.ent to make id, unique to ent_type
X- Make consolidated key target field: P100, A100, G100
X- Adjust all subordinate tables to point to the target field
- Test json tally import/export
- Only allow minimum, required access/permissions
- Can run equally well from schema source build, or from compiled schema build
- 

User initiated commands:
- Initiate tally with (peer)
- Send money to (peer)
- Send invoice to (peer)
- Set sell target of (issue)
- Set buy target for (issue)
- Get balance summary (date)
- Get income/expense summary (start, end)
- 

User SPA:

- Can export user to JSON
- Can export user to paper, w/ QR code
-  Admin can edit, create documents
-   

Wyseman:
- Create noise-protocol API for user interfaces
- Regular socket connection relies solely on an auth key (key file, not keys stored in DB user tables)
- Use SNI extension for client to provide db config payload
- Is there any use case for a user connecting via regular socket? (native app?)
-   If so, socket connection needs to use connection tokens/keys just like websocket
- Make database owned by mychips? (give admin read/write/delete but not create/drop)
- 

Preferences:
- App widget responsible for saving/restoring preference settings
- Other modules can supply their own prefs defaults until better DB metadata arrives
- Request wm Language object from app instead of direct from wyseman?
- Request pr object from app instead of from prefs?
- Make pdm option for fetching options from database via query (idx,title,help)
- Make standard shortcut for language (there will be others too)
- Can now select languages from prefs menu and app updates reactively
- Make standard shortcut for exists, given DB table, column
- 

Wylib:
- I get errors on reload when dbe and dbs both open on a dbp
- Implement default load column in views, wylib uses it if present
- Implement default order column in views, wylib uses it if present
